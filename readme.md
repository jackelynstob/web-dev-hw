# My Intro-Wev-Dev Homework Repo
## Jackelyn Stob
I chose this class because I have enjoyed coding since I was in 5th grade, where I dabbled in HTML coding throughout the rest of middle school. In high school I also took an Intro to Web Design class and it was such a blast! Something about being able to manipulate variables through code or sometimes what feels like math problems & then being able to see immediate results is truly fun for me. I took a break for about 3 years and never developed my knowledge (until now)! I am also going to school for my BFA in Digital Arts and Technologies, so while this class in mandatory, I firmly believe it will be my favorite one throughout my collegiate career.
* The internet is separate from the web in that the internet is a "network of networks", connecting computers together, and the web is one portion of the internet that allows people to access information.
* The internet is basically a wire, a physical entity.
* 80% of the World Wide Web is hidden from most users, and is known as the 'dark web'.
* There are a lot of puns to be made when it comes to the connection of the web and the ocean.
* There are two key pieces in the puzzle that makes up the web: front end programming and back end programming.
* There are many different programming languages that are used for slightly different things.
