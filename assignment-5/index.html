      <h1>Sing Along with Amy Winehous!</h1>
      <pre>
          All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew
          And this regret I got accustomed to
          Once it was so right
          When we were at our height
          Waiting for you in the hotel at night
          I knew I hadn't met my match
          But every moment we could snatch
          I don't know why I got so attached
          It's my responsibility
          You don't owe nothing to me
          But to walk away, I have no capacity
          He walks away
          The sun goes down
          He takes the day, but I'm grown
          And in your way
          In this blue shade
          My tears dry on their own
          I don't understand
          Why do I stress the man
          When there's so many bigger things at hand?
          We could've never had it all
          We had to hit a wall
          So this is inevitable withdrawal
          Even if I stop wanting you
          And perspective pushes through
          I'll be some next man's other woman soon
          I cannot play my self again
          I should just be my own best friend
          Not fuck my self in the head with stupid men
          He walks away
          The sun goes down
          He takes the day, but I'm grown
          And in your way
          In this blue shade
          My tears dry on their own
          So we are history
          Your shadow covers me
          The sky above ablaze
          He walks away
          The sun goes down
          He takes the day, but I'm grown
          And in your way
          In this blue shade
          My tears dry on their own
          I wish I could sing no regrets
          And no emotional debt
          'Cause as we kissed goodbye, the sun sets
          So we are history
          Your shadow covers me
          The sky above ablaze
          That only lovers see
          He walks away
          The sun goes down
          He takes the day, but I'm grown
          And in your way
          In this blue shade
          My tears dry on their own
          Whoa, he walks away
          The sun goes down
          He takes the day, but I'm grown
          And in your way
          My deep shade
          My tears dry on their own
          He walks away
          The sun goes down
          He takes the day, but I'm grown
          And in your way
          My deep shade
          My tears dry
