  <h3>January</h3>
  <p>So I guess I should begin by telling you all <em>why I</em> decided to run a marathon. At the beginning of 2017, the person closest to me was diagnosed with Chron's disease. Malia Levison has conquered life more than anyone I have ever met, even with a disease that impacts her every day. She is motivated, selfless, kind, and my personal saving grace. She has managed to juggle work, exercise, school, fire fighting training, doctors appointments, and getting a good nights sleep all throughout consistant flare ups. I'm lucky to have her to look up to and motivate me the way she does. So for her, I'm running this marathon to raise funds and awareness for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Her willpower is there for her when her body fails her. So I choose to push my body to it's limits during this marathon the way hers does, and rely on my willpower and the support of you all to get through it. On top of running miles for Malia, I'm running for myself. I've always wanted to be apart of something that was all on my own, and this is it.

  <h3>February</h3>
  <p>During this time I have learned some things about myself and about how my body is adapting to the stress of a new workout regime. First thing is first, I have IBS, which has significantly effected my running routine. I have learned that if I eat less than an hour before a run, sharp pains in my stomach emerge, my run stops completely, and I'm stuck on the toilet for about 45 minutes. Sorry to be graphic, but it's just what my experience is. On top of my IBS, I've actually learned that "runner's trots" are a <em>thing</em>. Apparently, diarrhea is a major concern for many athletes, especially those in running sports. About 20-50% of endurance athletes suffer from the need to immediately use the bathroom. This happens due to jostling of the intestines which reduces blood flow to them as the body sends more to the muscles in use. This stimulates changes in the intestinal hormones which speed up transit time and alters absorption rate. Dehydration can also make this worse (yet another reason to make sure you drink the proper amount of water). I know, one would think that with my already existing bowel problem on top of my sensitivity to this problem that I would quit, but knowing others out there are experiencing the same issue <em>and perservering</em> only motivates me more. And to cycle back to the <strong>damn reason I'm running in the first place</strong> (duh, my friend's bowel disease), it almost feels poetic, in a very, very stinky way. While I work to raise money toward a cure for Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, I'm also learning more about my body and how I can work around my personal bowel issues.

  <h3>February Cont'd</h3>
  <p>Learning more about my body and how it works/reacts to foods and exercise has been a very insightful experience for me. Moreso, it's also driven me to focus on proper nutrition and what works for me. I've struggled with healthy eating habits and it's been a beautiful relief to focus on a goal that isn't body-image oriented. I want to push myself, I want to achieve this goal, I want to bring awareness to bowel disease, and I want to be healthy and kick ass while doing it. None of these reasons for me running have anything to do with losing weight or looking a certain way (there is also nothing wrong with those motivators I just hope y'all know you're beautiful no matter what.) But for me to begin a journey like this and only having the end goal of finishing a marathon is a huge step for my mental sanity. This marathon inspiration has gifted me with a healthier way of life I couldn't gift myself, and that's enough of a reason in itself to be grateful.

  <h3>March</h3>
  <p>First 100 miles down! Some of these have been hard, and some of these have been wonderful, but all of them have brought me closer to my goal. During training so far I've completed 3 races (8k, 5k, 7 miler) and plan to run a 10.2 mile, 11 mile, and a 1/2 marathon before the big full!!! My experiences with running races has been so amazing. The environment, energy, encouragement of a community race all come together to fuel you faster than you can imagine. Just being surrounded by others sounds scary, but it in fact motivated me more and provided me with an open environment to focus on the fun of it. Missoula has a wonderfully accepting runner's community and I'd highly recommend finding a supportive one in your area as well. Another beneficial factor in my training has been the app Strava. Logging my runs, tracking them, reviewing my stats, and being able to connect with friends and family who also run has provided me with friendly competition (both with myself and others) and allowed me to see how I'm actually progressing. 100 miles down, many many many to go.
