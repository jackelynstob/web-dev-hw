    <h3><center>Meal Plan:</center></h3>
    <center><p>Follow a healthy diet, your body needs it. <strong>No, Seriously.</strong> Through trial and error and living vicariously through others' painful mistakes, I've learned that nutrition is #1 in training. If your body isn't fueled properly, it may lead to an increased risk in injury, and completely impact your endurance and strength negatively. Proper hydration is also essential when it comes to not only endurance sports, but also life! If you're one whose not used to drinking a lot of water, take baby steps! <strong>There's nothing wrong with baby steps.</strong> We all think if we are going to take something on, diving head first into it is the best way when in fact it isn't! Building healthy habits and a healthy lifestyle takes time and maintaining these habits it's more likely if you allow yourself to build to your goal. This nutrition guide is a <u>sample</u> that you don't have to follow perfectly! For me, I'm a pescatarian, so the majority of the meat based meals I have to modify. Substitutions will be necessary in your meal plans as to not get bored of it. Allow yourself cheat meals, and give in to your cravings from time to time! This training is supposed to be realistic, so allow it to be.

    <h3><center>Training Plan:</center></h3>
    <p><center>Okay y'all, this is a <strong><u>16 Week Marathon Training Guide</u></strong> and this bad boy goes fast and it goes hard. If it seems too intimidating, I'd recommend a 20 or 24 week training guide to follow which helps beginners build endurance at an easier pace. However, if you're up for the challenge, give this guide a try! I want to begin this by again stressing the importance of not hurting yourself!! In this plan, there is typically 1 rest day/week. You are more than welcome to take 2 if that's what your body calls for. As for the cross training days, these are equally as important as your run days. Here - I'll say it again: <u>These are equally as important as your run days.</u> These are here to help build and maintain muscles that are helpful when running. Allowing yourself a few days off of running while still working toward your goal by strengthening your back, glutes, and leg muscles can help take stress off of other parts of your body during a run. However, for me if I do need to take a day out for an extra rest day, I typically let my cross training day be the one that suffers. Which day you choose is completely up to you, but I would not recommend letting it be your long run unless you're really injured. Again, this is a <u>sample</u> guide and here to give you a base to go off of. Personalize, customize, do whatever the frick you want to that will make this a more fun and all around better experience for you! Just be safe and kick ass!!</center></p>
