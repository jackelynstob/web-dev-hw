### How Data Travels:
Data travels through the internet by breaking information up into packets. When the information (say, an image) is broken up, these pieces/packets follow one or more paths to reach their destination. Instead of a one way path, multiple pathway options are provided for the information to take. However, these routes aren't determined by the packets. Instead, each of the packets that make up the image we are sending have a two numbers attached to them: the IP address of where they came from, and the IP address of where they are going. Since all of these packets have the same destination, they are able to take different paths than their other pieces by flowing through different routers. Sometimes the pieces don't arrive at the same time or even out of order, and with help from the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) the pieces are reassembled and displayed on the other computer.
### What is an IP Address?
An IP address works similarly to your address. The city, state, country, zip code, etc. are all identifying pieces as to where one needs to send information (let's use the example of a letter) for it to get to you. The person sending the letter has their own location where they are sending it *from* to get *to* you. Both of these addresses are written on the letter, therefor both location pieces are attached to the information being transmitted. Every device on the internet has their own address known as their IP address. When sending information, the IP address of the computer sending is attached to the packet of information as well as the IP address of the destination device. An IP address is composed of a series of numbers which represent bits and are organized in a specific way (the beginning numbers representing networks and the later numbers representing sub-networks). IPv4 was the original system for applying a device's IP address. With this system, the IP address was composed of 32 bits; providing 4 billion unique addresses, which is not enough. IPv6 is a new way of labelling device's that will be composed of 128 bits; providing 240 undecillion unique addresses.
### What is the DNS?
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system which connects a website's URL to it's corresponding IP address. When we type in "Facebook.com" into our browser, we are asking our computer to take us to a specific destination via a URL. Our computer then contacts the DNS, which will provide our computer with Facebook's IP address: "66.220.144.0 - 66.220.159.255. 69.63.176.0 - 69.63.191.255". Our computer then uses this information to bring us to our destination (Facebook.com). Multiple DNS zones are created to handle the amount of information coming from billions of devices wanting to retrieve millions of IP addresses.
### What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a file on a computer created by the browser on instructions from a webpage that has been requested by the user. The file contains information the webpages may need. Sometimes the information is used when going from one webpage on a site to another. Any user information entered on that webpage can be used on the next page of the same site. When a webpage is loaded in a browser, it looks for particular cookies which may contain useful information to remember you as a user like the last time you visited that site. Cookies typically have an expiration setting; sometimes only for one web browsing session, or days, weeks, years. This information can also be held onto invisibly by your computer in the form of an ID, and depending on the site, will know to call upon that information to recognize the returning user.
### What are the Three Basic Parts of a URL?
*The protocol's connected to the domain name and the domain names connected to the file path...*
  + The first part of the URL is the 'protocol', which is the set of information that declares *how* your web browser communicates when retrieving webpage information or a document from a server and *what* framework is being used to transmit that data. Examples of a protocol would be http, https, ftp and imap.
  + The second part of a URL is the 'domain name', which is specific and particular to a websites identification on the internet.
  + The third piece of the URL trifecta is the 'file path', which often has a tree structure for organization which allows a pathway to the information we needed through the hierarchical directories/files.
